    "To understand the video game industry, it is important to understand not just the video games themselves, but also the consoles they are released on. Understanding the relative popularity of different consoles can lend real insight into where the major players in the industry stand. For this analysis, we consider the popularity of the Xbox 360, one very well-known video game console by seeing what proportion of video games released between 2004 and 2010 were released on this console. We also provide a more general analysis on the overall popularity of the video game industry in this same time frame by attempting to infer the median sales of video games released in this period.\n",

    "The following analysis uses the video games dataset by Joe Cox, available online at https://doi.org/10.17029/d4fe28cd-1e44-4d2f-9db6-85b347bf761e. The dataset has information about the sales and playtime of almost 1800 video games released between 2004 and 2010. The data was collected and cleaned by Dr. Joe Cox, with information on the playtime coming from crowd-sourced data on the website [howlongtobeat.com](https://howlongtobeat.com/). We accessed this data on September 17, 2025, though the data was originally downloaded on February 8, 2024."

    "Using our sample of n=300 games, we estimated the population proportion of Xbox 360 releases. The observed sample proportion was 23.33%, and the 90% bootstrap CI was [19.33%, 27.67%], indicating that plausible population values lie within this range. For the hypothesis test on U.S. sales, we tested whether the population median U.S. sales for games released between 2004–2010 is less than 200,000 units. The test yielded p=0.023 at α=0.05, so we reject H0 and conclude there is statistically significant evidence that the true median U.S. sales is below 200,000. The CI for the proportion and the hypothesis-test conclusion address distinct questions but together suggest that Xbox 360 titles represent roughly a quarter of releases in our window, while median U.S. sales across titles were modest."
